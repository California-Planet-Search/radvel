\caption{ Best-fit {{ report.num_planets }}-planet Keplerian orbital model
  for {{ report.starname_tex }}. The maximum likelihood model is plotted while
  the orbital parameters listed in Table \ref{tab:params} are the
  median values of the posterior distributions.  The thin blue line is
  the best fit {{ report.num_planets }}-planet model. We add in quadrature
  the RV jitter term(s) listed in Table \ref{tab:params} with the
  measurement uncertainties for all RVs.  {\bf b)} Residuals to the
  best fit {{ report.num_planets }}-planet model. {\bf c)} RVs phase-folded
  to the ephemeris of planet b. The Keplerian orbital models for all
  other planets (if any) have been subtracted.  The small point colors
  and symbols are the same as in panel {\bf a}.  Red circles (if
  present) are the same velocities binned in 0.08 units of orbital
  phase.  The phase-folded model for planet b is shown as the blue
  line.}
