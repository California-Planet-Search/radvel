Quickstart Tutorial
===================

1. Create a planetary system configuration file. Use the `HD164922.py`  
   file within the `example_planets` directory as an example or template.
2. Run the ``kepfit.py`` executable in the `bin` directory with the
   full path to your planetary configuration file as the first
   argument. Run ``kepfit.py --help`` for a description of all available
   optional arguments.
3. The results will be placed in a directory with the same name as the
   ``starname`` variable in your planet configuration file.


For a more detailed tutorial in the use of the underlying API refer to
the example iPython notebooks in the `tests` directory.
